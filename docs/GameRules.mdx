# Game Rules

Codecharacter is a game of strategic resource management. The objective of the game for attacker is to destroy defenders base as much as possible using as less coins as possible and the defender’s objective is to kill the enemy attacking and save the base.  

There are two types of units
<ul>
  <li>Two kinds of towers</li>
  <li>Two kinds of troops</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
<b>Towers</b> - Towers are static and stay in their position and attacks when troops reach their range. Each tower has their own values and attributes

</div>

<b>Troops</b> - Troops can move and attack when defenders come in range. Troops can not pass through the tower.Troops can only be spawned at outer region of the map

</div>

Towers occupy a 1x1 unit square area on the map in an isometric view and troops cannot move through a tower. Troops attack the tower till its health drops completely. Towers get destroyed once their health reaches zero

Towers can be constructed on the tile till you have coins left in the store. Troops can be built through your code.

This is how a game map looks like :

<b>Goal of the game </b> - The attackers goal in the game is to destroy defender baseas much as possible using as less coins as possible and the defender’s goal is to kill the enemy attacking and save the base.
<br />
<br />
You will be given a fixed amount of coins to build your defender base. You have to code your attacker base.
